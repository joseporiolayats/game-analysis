# Game Analysis
### Dataset creation & Analysis for insight on player behaviors
The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate my data, programming and business understanding via solving a problem of analyzing the data of a fictional mobile game with a lot of users.

The dataset will be synthetic and may not reflect actual player behavior on mobile games. Nonetheless, I will do my best to simulate a full array of players, from casual to fanatic.
### Dataset specifications
The dataset should include data on:
- User id
- Session id
- Session time
- Menu time
- Playing time
